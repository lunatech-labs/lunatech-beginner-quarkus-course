# lunatech-beginner-quarkus-course

Lunatech's beginner Quarkus training course aimed at developers who may or may not already be familiar with other frameworks.

## Repository Structure

### `slides`

The `slides` directory contain the reveal.js slides with the course material. Run it with:

    npm install
    npm start

and then browse to `http://localhost:8000/`

### `student-app-finished`

This is intended to contain the 'finished' student app; the HIQUEA catalogue app.

But currently it's in use also to contain the code examples that are used in the slides, to make sure they work. We should split this project into two :)
